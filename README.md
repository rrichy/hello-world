The traditional helloworld

Hello fellow humans!

This is the first commit that I will be doing and I hope many more would come. I am currently looking for a way to start a
carreer in coding but I do not know where to start. I am currently a 3 kyu rank in codewars but I do not think I can get a
job from there. Though I can practice from some problems.

Thank you for you time!
